# common.nix

This repository is a small library of `nixos` modules I made for myself and helper functions in [`./lib/default.nix`](./lib/default.nix). I was having multiple pieces of the same code in separate repositories and machines. We all know what happens when you have the same code functionality in multiple places... it gets messy.


GitHub is mirror, the repository is located at [sr.ht](https://git.sr.ht/~sebohe/common.nix).

## TODO

- [ ] Create a wrapped nvim based on this: https://github.com/pete3n/nixvim-flake/blob/main/flake.nix#L46
- [ ] Create a tui module that has the different you need for your development environment
