# common.nix

This repository is a small library of `nixos` modules I made for myself and helper functions in [`./lib/default.nix`](./lib/default.nix). I was having multiple pieces of the same code in separate repositories and machines. We all know what happens when you have the same code functionality in multiple places... it gets messy.
